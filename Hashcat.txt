1- sometimes it doesn't matter if Hashcat identify the hash file as a file or mac address, for example see log1 and log2 and that may become irrelevant with the new version
P.S. I can not test the new Hashcat because old GPU driver

2- You must always set an output file. Because sometime, Hashcat will continue hashing. Even if it has found a matching hash

hashcat64.exe -m 2500  -a 3 hccapxfile ?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d -o rasfirsttest.txt

hashcat64.exe -m 2500  -a 3 hccapxfile ?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d -o sam.txt

3- You can use Wireshark to clear up cap files 
sa means source
da means destination
the sa and da must be both the router mac address
the filter will be like this 

wlan.sa == 1c:3b:f3:e8:78:82 || wlan.da == 1c:3b:f3:e8:78:82

to export the filter, refer to "export for hashcat.PNG"
